The program starts with the initialization of the variable x with the string "Yes" so that the while loop is executed at least once. Inside the loop, it asks the user to enter two numbers (a and b) and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, or /). Through the use of conditional statements (if-elif-else), the program performs the respective mathematical operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. If the user enters an invalid operator, an error message is returned. After performing the operation and displaying the result, the program asks the user if they want to continue by entering "Yes" or "NO". If the user enters "Yes", the loop is repeated; otherwise, it stops. This implementation allows repeated calculations until the user wants to stop.
